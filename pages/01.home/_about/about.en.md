[section name="feature_5_description"]Local grammars are a powerful formalism for describing syntactic or semantic rules. It consists of finite state automata coupled with <a target="_blank" href="language-resources">electronic dictionaries</a> to perform automatic analysis of textual data. Unitex/GramLab features a rich visual IDE which allows users to easily design, test, debug, maintain and apply local grammars on a text[/section]
