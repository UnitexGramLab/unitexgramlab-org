Unitex/GramLab is a comprehensive suite of tools designed for linguistic research
and text processing. It combines powerful resources for language processing,
such as morphological and syntactic analysis, with user-friendly interfaces to
facilitate the creation, modification, and testing of local grammar-based ressources.

In this blog post, we'll walk you through the basics of getting started with Unitex/GramLab.

# Book <small>(new)</small>

For those who prefer a structured and in-depth approach to learning, there
is a comprehensive book available: "Unitex Getting Started" (2024) by Denis Maurel
(Tours University, France) and Cvetana Krstev (Language Resources and Technologies
Society JeRTeh and University of Belgrade, Serbia). This book explores Unitex's
theoretical foundations and practical applications, providing a thorough understanding
of its capabilities.

The purpose of "Unitex Getting Started" is to help its readers get started with Unitex.
This book is suitable for beginners, but there are also sections for more advanced users that are marked "only for confident users".

It covers most of its possibilities, although not all of them, namely:

- Chapter 2 (**First Steps**): Installing and getting started with Unitex; Using dictionaries; Creating simple graphs.
- Chapter 3 (**Corpus Annotation**): Creating complex graphs with output; using weights; morphological mode.
- Chapter 4 (**CasSys**): Creating cascades of graphs; generalization graphs, negative right context, using variables; testing variables.
- Chapter 5 (**Creating dictionaries**): Dictionaries; inflection graphs; dictionary graphs.
- Chapter 6 (**Other tools**): Creating graphics based on a lexicon-grammar; aligning texts.
- Chapter 7 (**Scripts**): Creating scripts.

This book proposes a large number of exercises and micro-projects that can be carried out, step by step, by following the text. The chapters are relatively independent. A user already familiar with Unitex can use this book as a collection of correct examples.

The book comes with a zipped file (MyUnitex.zip) containing all the correct files (graphs, cascades, dictionaries, scripts, etc.) for the exercises. The early chapters also include videos showing the step-by-step construction of the graphs.
