# Reporting Bugs

See the [Bug Reporting Guide](/how-to-report-a-bug) for information on how to report bugs.

# Governance Model

Unitex/GramLab project decision-making is based on a community meritocratic process. Anyone with an interest in it can join the community, contribute to the project design and participate in decisions. The [Unitex/GramLab Governance Model](http://governance.unitexgramlab.org?target=_blank) describes how this participation takes place and how to set about earning merit within the project community.

# Spelling

Unitex/GramLab is spelled with capitals "U" "G" and "L", and with everything else in lower case. Excepting the forward slash, do not put a space or any character between words. When the forward slash is not allowed, you can simply write “UnitexGramLab”

It's common to refer to the Unitex/GramLab Core as "Unitex", and to the Unitex Project-oriented IDE as "GramLab". If you are mentioning the distribution suite (Core, IDE, Linguistic Resources and others bundled tools) always use "Unitex/GramLab".
